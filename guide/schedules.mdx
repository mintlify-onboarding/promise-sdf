title: "Workflows, Schedules, & Partitions"
---

The modern data warehouse at scale is populated, edited, and analyzed via a set of data workflows (or pipelines). Without these, data warehouses would be static and would not be able to keep up with the ever-changing needs of the business.
A data pipeline or workflow is a sequence of data processing steps, e.g. fetching data from external sources, transforming data, and loading data into other systems.
In order to keep downstream systems up to date, data pipelines are often scheduled to run at regular intervals. Furthermore, to limit the amount of data that needs to be processed, data is often partitioned by time at a specific grain (degree to time granularity). 

Traditional *data orchestration* systems force the developer to explicitly declare the dependencies between tasks, i.e. the order in which tasks are executed. You may have seen this with the `>>` operator in [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org). This is tedious and error prone, especially when tasks are scheduled to run at regular intervals.
SDF automatically infers dependencies between the tasks's queries. That's right, the beautiful SQL you've been writing for years contains the dependencies within it. Combined with a simple schedule declaration in the table block of an [sdf.yml](/reference/sdf-yml#top-level-element-table), SDF is able to orchestrate your entire data workflow on the specified cadence with extra respect paid to partitions. 

<Tip>
SDF infers the DAG (directed acyclic graph) of your data pipeline from the SQL statements in your workspace. Combined with a simple schedule declaration, your entire SDF workspace is automatically orchestrated with ease.

## Workflow, Schedules, and Time Partitioning
Workflows, schedules, and time partitioned tables work well together to automate and orchestrate recurring data management tasks; everything from fetching data from external locations, performing data validation and transformation, and loading data into other systems. We first discuss their relationship and then look at an example in SDF. 

### Terminology
* A **workflow** is a collection of tasks executed in a particular dependency-based order. In SDF, a *task* builds a table and the order of *tasks* is defined by a  *use-define* relationship between tables. The goal of a workflow in SDF is to build one or more tables of a workspace. 
Suppose table `A` is defined by a `select` statement that references table `B` in its `from` clause. SDF turns `A` and `B` into tasks with the default goal of building both. Thanks to SDF's handy SQL static analysis, it understands the *use-define* relationship and concludes `B` must be built first before building `A` (remind you of a build system yet?) 
* SDF **schedules** allow workflows or tasks to recur at particular intervals. SDF uses *[cron-expressions](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html)* to specify intervals. Each time partitioned table must have an associated cron expression that describes exactly when that table is being built. For instance, attaching the cron expression “0 0 \* \* \*” to a table `T` means that `T` is scheduled for execution every day at midnight, or (reading the entries of the cron expression from left to right) SDF builds the table at minute 0, hour 0, every day of the month, every month, every day of the week. Once a table's task is scheduled for execution it first waits for all its upstream tasks it depends on to complete and then begins executing itself.

* In SDF, **time partitioned tables**  are specified by simply declaring one or more time-related columns as partition columns.   
Each time partition column also has a format string. Suppose partition a column named `dt` should only contain strings of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`. You can specify this with the format string `%Y-%m-%d`. The syntax of these format expressions is taken from the widely popular [strftime libray](https://strftime.org/).
* The  **grain** of a time partitioned table is the timespan between two successively scheduled iterations. For example, a *daily* partitioned table has a *daily grain*. Grains are often used to summarize or aggregate data. For instance, a daily grain might summarize a set of hourly grains. To schedule time partitioned tasks properly, *grains must align*, which we will discuss in more detail below. 

### Example 

Let's bring it all together in the form of an example. Suppose we have a data warehouse that tracks the activity of users. We want to build a table `dau` that contains the number of unique users that have performed some action on a given day.

#### Workspace File

(1) Let's start by installing the **sample** `dau` (for daily activity of users)
> `sdf new --sample dau dau` 
```yaml
```
(2) The **workspace** file specifies where to find source sql files as well as [sdf.yml](/reference/sdf-yml) configuration files and resource files.

> `cat workspace.sdf.yml`
```yaml
workspace:
  edition: 1
  includes: 
    - path: src/
  resources:
    - path: events/
```

(3) The resource files in this example are partitioned CSV files  providing data for an **external event** table. 
Every row in this table has an action (column `action`) and a user id (`uid`). 
Event table partitions are assumed to be landing every six hours, each partition containing data for the corresponding six hour interval. The interval is encoded in the  two partition columns: `dt` and `hr` containing the date and the hour respectively.

The event table's schema is defined in the following `.sql` file.
> `cat src/events.sql`
```sql
create external table events(
    dt varchar, 
    hr varchar, 
    action varchar, 
    uid bigint
) stored as csv  partitioned by (dt, hr) location 'events/';
```

(4)The SQL DDL language is not rich enough to capture all the semantics of this table, e.g. the above SQL statement does not define the temporal frequency of partitions (every 6 hours) or which format should be used for `dt` and `hour` values. 
All of this is specified in the configuration file `events.sdf.yml`. The `schedule` field uses a *cron expression* to tell SDF the data lands every day at 0,6,12 and 18 hours. The `format` specification for the `dt` and `hr` tell SDF how to format its values. Finally,`events.sdf.yml` specifies the table is external via the `materialization` property.

> `cat src/events.sdf.yml`
```yaml
table:
  name: events
  schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
  partitioned-by:
    - name: "dt"
      format: "%Y%m%d"
    - name: "hr"
      format: "%H"
  materialization: external
```

On disk the `events` table for two concrete days is layed out like this:  

> `tree event`

 ```yaml
events
├── dt=20220102
│   ├── hr=00
│   │   └── data.csv
│   ├── hr=06
│   │   └── data.csv
│   ├── hr=12
│   │   └── data.csv
│   └── hr=18
│       └── data.csv
└── dt=20220103
    ├── hr=00
    │   └── data.csv
    ├── hr=06
    │   └── data.csv
    ├── hr=12
    │   └── data.csv
    └── hr=18
        └── data.csv
```

<Note>
This example demonstrates an "external" table defined by local files. We can also configure an external table to point to remote files -- for example, in an S3 bucket.
</Note>

#### Variables and Partitions on the Same Grain

Now that we understand our workspace, let's look at how partitions are injected into our queries.

First, let's try counting all actions per user by partition and represent the result as yet another time-partitioned table. The query `hau.sql` together with its metadata description `hau.sdf.yml` does so.
> `cat src/hau.sql`
```sql
select
    dt, hr, uid, count(action) action_count_total
from
    events
where
    dt = @dt and hr = @hr
group by
    dt,hr,uid;
```

As you can see from the `where` clause, the query `hau.sql` is parametric. The variables `@dt` and `@hr` are implicitly created for the partition columns `dt` and `hr` of this table (as defined in `hau.sdf.yml`.) When a task runs for a particular six hour interval, the SDF scheduler substitutes the corresponding date and time values for these variables.

> `cat  src/hau.sdf.yml`
```yaml
table:
  name: hau
  schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
  partitioned-by:
    - name: "dt"
      format: "%Y%m%d"
    - name: "hr"
      format: "%H" 
```

<Note>
The `hau.sdf.yml` looks exactly like the `event.sdf.yml`. They share the same schedule and as such run at the same time. However, note that `hau.sdf.yml` is missing the `materialization`. Hence by default `hau` will be cached.
</Note>

#### Building for a Particular Time 

To build a time partitioned table for a particular time you need a binding for `@dt` and `@hr`. In SDF you provide the binding for partition variables via the `--date` or, as we'll see later, the `--from` and `--to` parameters.

For instance, to count all actions per user for a particular date and time, call `sdf build` like so:
> `sdf build src/hau.sql --date 2022-01-02T00:00 --no-show`
> 
*Note, the `--no-show` option causes SDF to omit outputting a fragment of the resulting table to STDOUT.*
```yaml
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
    Written .sdfcache/dau/pub/events/dt=20220102/hr=00/
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
    Written .sdfcache/dau/pub/hau/dt=20220102/hr=00/
    Written .sdfcache/assembly.sdf.yml
   Finished build in 0.341 secs
```
The provided date parameter (which must be a prefix of [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339)), is mapped to partition variables using the provided format conversion. 

We see the result of the execution materialized in `.sdfcache`.
> tree .sdfcache
```yaml
.sdfcache
├── assembly.sdf.yml
└── dau
    └── pub
        ├── events
        │   └── dt=20220102
        │       └── hr=00
        │           └── part-0.parquet
        └── hau
            └── dt=20220102
                └── hr=00
                    ├── part-0.parquet
```
Calling `sdf build` with a date for which there is no data results in an empty table. 

#### Building for a a time range

To build tables for a time range, provide the flags `--from` and `--to` with valid RFC 3339 dates.

<Note>
`from` is *inclusive* and `to` is *exclusive* when providing a time range to SDF via the command line
</Note>

> `sdf build src/hau.sql --from 2022-01-02 --to 2022-01-03`
```yaml
    Running dau.pub.events dau.pub.hau --date 2022-01-02T00:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
   ---
    Running dau.pub.events dau.pub.hau --date 2022-01-02T06:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
   ---
    Running dau.pub.events dau.pub.hau --date 2022-01-02T12:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
   ---
    Running dau.pub.events dau.pub.hau --date 2022-01-02T18:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
```

<Tip>
As you can see from the output above, SDF just ran *backfill* for this data warehouse. Orchestrators like Apache Airflow run into the notorious **backfill problem**, where [complex programs](TODO (wolfram):insert-link) are required in order for new schema changes to be propagated back in time through partitions. In SDF, this comes fully out of the box - simply provide a time range and `sdf build` will do the rest.
</Tip>

Another aspect worth noting is that SDF's rebuilds are smart. Suppose that you decided to rebuild an even larger time range, like `--from 2022-01-02 --to 2022-01-04`. Then simply say so, the system will leverage any previous work already done.


> `sdf build src/hau.sql --from 2022-01-02 --to 2022-01-04`
```yaml
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T00:00
    Reusing dau.pub.events, dau.pub.hau
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T06:00
    Reusing dau.pub.events, dau.pub.hau
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T12:00
    Reusing dau.pub.hau, dau.pub.events
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T18:00
    Reusing dau.pub.hau, dau.pub.events
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-03T00:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-03T06:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-03T12:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
    --
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-03T18:00
   Building dau.pub.events (./src/events.sql)
   Building dau.pub.hau (./src/hau.sql)
```
We see that all partitions that have been built before are simply reused. In fact, SDF only builds what is necessary. For more cache details, see our deep dive on the [SDF Cache](/reference/caching).

#### Building Partitions on Different Time Grains.

The `dau` table (where `dau` stands for *d*aily *a*ctive *u*sers) summarizes the 6-hourly `hau` (*h*ourly *a*ctive *u*sers) table. 

> `cat src/hau.sql`
```sql
select
    dt,uid,sum(action_count_total) as action_count_total
from
    hau
where
    dt = @dt
group by
    dt,uid
```
While `dau` references `hau`, it specifies its partition predicate as just `dt = @dt`. As such, `dau` summarizes all partitions of `hau` from the same day.

Since `dau` summarizes a time range you should only build `dau` with `--from` and `--to`. This guarantees that the proper `hau` partitions are landed before `dau` runs. Let's see it in action.

> `sdf build src/dau.sql --from 2022-01-02 --to 2022-01-03`
```yaml
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T00:00
    Reusing dau.pub.events, dau.pub.hau
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T06:00
    Reusing dau.pub.hau, dau.pub.events
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T12:00
    Reusing dau.pub.events, dau.pub.hau
    Running dau.pub.hau dau.pub.events --date 2022-01-02T18:00
    Reusing dau.pub.hau, dau.pub.events
    Running dau.pub.dau --date 2022-01-02
    Reusing dau.pub.hau, dau.pub.events
   Building dau.pub.dau (./src/dau.sql)
```
The provided console output shows that all hourly tables are already available. As a byproduct, the only table to be built is `dau`.

You might be asking yourself, why wasn't `dau` built earlier on? Well, that's because SDF was clever enough to figure out that `dau` requires *all hourly partitions* to be built before it can build, otherwise the data would be innaccurate.

## Recursive tables
Ever wanted to implement recursion in SQL? We did, and we did it in a way that is both easy to use and efficient. Let's see how it works.

### Non-recursive accumulation

To compute the total number of events per user over the whole lifetime of a service we could write the following query, called `dau_slow`.
> `cat src/dau_slow.sql`
```sql
create table dau_slow as
select
    @dt as dt, uid, sum(action_count_total) as action_count_total
from
  dau
where
    dt < @dt
group by
    dt, uid
```
Initially `dau_slow` is actually not that slow (haha), but over time *non-recursive accumulation becomes slower*. This is because the query always has to recompute everything from the beginning of time. If only we had a build system to figure out what had already be done...

### Recursive accumulation
An alternative way to author such accumulating tables is to define them recursively. Below, you'll see a more efficient version of this accumulating table, which we call  `dau_fast`. This new query establishes the invariant that each `@dt` partition simply stores `dau_slows`'s result for that day. Leveraging this invariant, `dau_fast` computes today's partition by reading yesterday's partition and composing it with today's `dau` partition.  

> `cat src/dau_fast.sql`

```sql
create recursive table dau_fast as 
with 
    today as (select  * from dau where dt=@dt),
    yesterday (select * from dau_fast where date(dt)+'interval 1 day'=@dt)
select 
  @dt as dt,
  coalesce(today.uid, yesterday.uid) as uid
  coalesce(today.action_total_count, 0) + (yesterday.action_total_count, 0) as action_total_count
from today
outer join yesterday 
using (uid)
```
Before we can execute above query we have to specify `dau_fast`s partition scheme and `recursive` materialization. 
> `cat  src/dau_fast.sdf.yml`
```yaml
table:
  name: dau_fast
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  partitioned-by:
    - name: "dt"
      format: "%Y-%m-%d"
  materialization: recursive
```
Now we can execute recursive queries like any other query:
> `sdf build src/dau_fast --from 2022-01-02 --to 2022-01-04`
```yaml
...TBD...
```
Again we see that all intermediate results, like `dau` have been cached and reused. Oh, the power of build systems...

## Current Implementation Restrictions
The current implementation has the following restrictions
* Time partitioned columns must be of type `varchar`
* Each time partitioned query can only write to one partition at a time. That partition value must be the same as the value of a variable. 
* Time partition filters can currently only use equality predicates and can only appear in conjunctions.
* The schedule for time partitioned tables that reference each other must be synchronized. So if `A` and `B` have the same grain they have to start on the same time. If `A` and `B` have a different grain, then `A` and `B` still must have a common time when they can be scheduled and one grain must be a multiple of the other.
