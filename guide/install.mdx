## SDF Versions and Updating

From time to time, it may be necessary to update the cli to get the latest and
greatest features, or to connect to SDF Cloud Services.

If you've already installed SDF, you can update to the latest version by running
the command below. By default, this will update to the latest version of the
cli. But, you can also pass `--version` and `--install-location` parameters.

```bash
$sdf update
```

You can check the version of your current CLI with

```bash
sdf 0.0.94-dev
```

## Uninstalling SDF

If you ever need to uninstall SDF, run

```bash
$sdf uninstall
```
